# Text Mining and Agriculture 

Text mining is a mature technique that has been used in a number of fields such as Finance and Bio-Medicine. Text mining is underused in agriculture, and therefore to encourage research in this area the BrAgriNews Corpus is being released to the research community to encourage the development of NLP techniques for agriculture.

## Agriculture Text Mining Research

This corpus was developed as part of the Post-Doctoral research of [Brett Drury](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=tuOaq-4AAAAJ&hl=en) at University of Sao Paulo (ICMC) in Sao Carlos under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Alneu Lopes](http://conteudo.icmc.usp.br/pessoas/alneu/) and was supported by the FAPESP research agency of Sao Paulo. The project built [Bayesian Networks from Text](http://www.bv.fapesp.br/37622). This work is being currently continued by [Robson Fernandes](robsonfernandes.net) also under the supervision of Alneu Lopes.

## Corpus Details
